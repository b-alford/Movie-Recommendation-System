# Movie-Recommendation-System

This project demonstrates a Python-based movie recommendation system using the MovieLens 25M dataset. By leveraging Pandas for data manipulation and scikit-learn's TF-IDF Vectorizer and cosine similarity, the system can suggest movies similar to a given title. An interactive interface, built with Jupyter widgets, allows users to input movie titles and receive real-time recommendations. This project highlights techniques in data preprocessing, machine learning, and user interface development, providing a practical tool for personalized movie recommendations.
